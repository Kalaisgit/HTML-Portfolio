<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An aspiring SDE</p>

<p>
  Greetings! I'm Kalaiselvan CK, embarking on an exciting journey into software
  development. With 1 year and 5 months of industry experience as a software
  engineer at a service-based company behind me, I've returned from a refreshing
  career break of about 1 year, now actively sharpening my skills in Data
  Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
</p>

<p>
  During this period, I've successfully tackled 185+ problems across renowned
  platforms such as Coding Ninjas, LeetCode, and GeeksforGeeks.
